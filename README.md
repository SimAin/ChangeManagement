# Change Management

This Change Management solution was the final project for my Computer Science degree, entitled "Scheduling workload using change data". The project aimed to build an application that enabled businesses with diverse teams and multiple integrated systems to efficiently manage change and view an ordered task list. This aim was a response to the following problem statement.

## Problem statement

Change management solutions are complex and weigh heavily on the archiving requirement, rather than giving a clear view of change. Due to this, users can be reluctant to use solutions, and changes lack exact details. Therefore, teams will not necessarily know about all the tasks assigned to them and, specifically, the priority and most efficient order to action them.

## The solution

This solution is a C# web that was designed with a SQL database to be hosted in Azure.
